Rock_paper_scissors:
You can play with an AI/bot or let them play with each other to figure out who is the strongest.
You can also save what you have trained to an AI into a file.
My AI in the file is a class called faded_AI (I name it as this because my Blizzard account name is faded.)
You can change the dim variable of my AI to decide how many steps are considered for AI to make a decision.
win_rate in this file and code is win/(win+lose)
I have tested my AI,it has a good win rate againt me,
have 100% win_rate (after training) againt some choice_list like
(1,2,3,3,2,1,1,2,3,3,2,1.....) (when dim>4),
100% win_rate against some choice_strategy,
like most class and copy class in my code,
and it will also consider your preference of some choice,
as it has a good win_rate against offset_rand.
